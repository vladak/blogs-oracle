Still, with all these goodies it required fair amount of exploration before I figured things out. Being a BSD person some of them were not surprising, whereas some of them slowed me down substantialy.</p><p>I don't remember now the origin of the thought to summarize the installation steps and basic steps after installation to make the system more useable, this is not important. Anyway, the slides containing all of this information (and more) were made.<br/><br/>The slides were originaly meant for <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/os_user_groups/czosug/">CZOSUG</a> Bootcamp where people brought their laptops and installed Solaris on them. I have created the slides together with <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/janp/">Jan Pechanec</a> . After watching both external people and new-hires struggle with basic steps after completing Solaris installation I think they could be used also to ease those post-install how-do-I-set-this steps.</p><p>They are not perfect, could contain errors (please do report them) but here you go:</p><ul><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/resource/Simple_Solaris_Installation-v1_6.pdf">Simple Solaris Installation slides</a></ul><p>Also, do not forget to look at <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=591">recently founded</a> <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/immigrants/">Immigrants community</a> at <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">opensolaris.org</a> which contains other goodies such as links to <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/">Ben Rockwood</a>'s <a href="http://cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=562">Accelerated introduction to Solaris</a>.
