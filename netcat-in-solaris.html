                                                                    <p><a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=4664622">CR 4664622</a> has been integrated into <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/on/">Nevada</a> and will be<br/>part of build 80 (which means it will not be part of next <br/><a href="http://developers.sun.com/sxde/">SXDE</a> release but I can live with that :)).</p><p>During the course of getting the process done I have stumbled upon several interesting obstacles. For example, during ingress Open Source Review I was asked by our <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/lr/">open-source caretaker</a> what will be the "<i>support model</i>" for Netcat once it is integrated. I was puzzled. Because, for Netcat, support is not really needed since it has been around for ages (ok, since 1996 according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">wikipedia</a>) and is pretty stable piece of code which is basically no longer developed. Nonetheless, this brings some interesting challenges with move to a community model where more and more projects are integrated by people outside Sun (e.g. <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/ksh93-integration/">ksh93 project</a>).</p><p>The nc(1) man page will be delivered in build 81. In the meantime you can read<br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/entry/netcat_pkg_and_code_review">Netcat review blog entry</a> which contains the link to updated man page.<br/>The older version of the man page is contained in the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/caselog/2007/389/mail">mail communication</a> for <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/caselog/2007/389/">PSARC 2007/389</a>.<br/><br/><br/>Note: I have realized that the <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/arc/">ARC</a> case directory does not have to include most up-to-date man page at the time of integration.<br/>Only when something _architectural_ changes, then the man page has to be updated (which was not the case with Netcat since we only added new section describing how to setup nc(1) with <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/security/projects/rbac/">RBAC</a>). Thanks to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/carlson/">Jim</a> for the explanation.</p><p>I have some ideas how to make Netcat in Solaris even better and will work to get them done over time.<br/>In particular, there are following RFEs: 6515928, 6573202. However, this does not mean <br/>that there is only single person who can work on nc(1). Since it is now part of ONNV, <br/>anyone is free to hack it.</p><p>So, I'd like to invite everyone to participate - if you have an idea how to extend Netcat, what features to add, it is <a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.bin/nc/">sitting</a> in ONNV waiting for new <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/">RFEs</a> (or bugs) and <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/mailman/listinfo/request-sponsor">sponsor requests</a> (be sure to read <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jkini/">Jayakara Kini's</a> explanation of <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jkini/entry/contributing_to_opensolaris">how to contribute</a> if you're not OpenSolaris contributor yet).</p><p>Also, if you're Netcat user and use Netcat in a cool way, I want to hear that !</p>
