                                                                    <p>Two weeks ago (yeah, I am a slacker) <a href="www.first.org">FIRST</a><br/><a href="http://www.first.org/events/colloquia/jan2008/">technical colloquium</a><br/>was held in Prague and we (me and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sashan/">Sasha</a>) <br/>were given the opportunity to attend (the fact the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/drscholl/">Derrick</a> serves as FIRST chair in the <br/><a href="http://www.first.org/about/organization/sc.html">steering comittee</a><br/>has of course something to do with it).</p><p>I only attended one day of the technical colloquium (<a href="http://www.first.org/events/colloquia/jan2008/program/#d20080129">Tuesday 29th</a>).<br/>The day was filled with various talks and presentations. Most of them were <br/>performed by various CERT teams members from around the world. This was because <br/>this event was a joint meeting of FIRST and <a href="http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/">TF-CSIRT</a>.<br/> It was definitely<br/>interesting to see very different approaches to the shared problem set (dealing with<br/>incidents, setting up honey pots, building forensic analysis labs, etc.).<br/>Not only these differences stemmed from sizes of the networks and organizations<br/>but also (and that was kind of funny) from nationalities.<br/><br/><br/>In the morning I talked about the integration of <br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/entry/netcat_in_solaris">Netcat into Solaris</a>,<br/>describing the process, current features and planned enhancements and extensions.</p><p>The most anticipated talk was by <a href="http://trifinite.org/trifinite_group_adam.html">Adam Laurie</a> who is entertaining guy involved in many hacker-like activities (see e.g. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,68370,00.html">A hacker games the hotel</a><br/>article by <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>) directed at proving insecurities in<br/>many publicly used systems.<br/><br/><br/>Adam (brother of Ben Laurie, author of <a href="http://www.apache-ssl.org/">Apache-SSL</a> <br/>and OpenSSL contributor) first started with intro about satellite scanning, insecure hotel safes<br/>(with backdoors installed by the manufacturers which can be overcome by a screwdriver).<br/>Then he proceeded to talk about RFID chips, mainly about cloning.</p><p>Also, at the "social event" in the evening I had the pleasure to share a table with<br/><a href="http://www.vanwyk.org/ken">Ken van Wyk</a> who is overall cool fellow and the author of <br/><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/securecdng">Secure coding</a> and <br/><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/incidentres">Incident response</a> books from O'Reilly.</p><p>In overall, it was interesting to see so many security types in a room and get to know some of<br/>them.</p>
