                                                                    <p>In <a href="http://opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris</a> world we very much care about correctness and hate regressions (of any kind).<br/>If I loosely paraphrase <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/">Bryan Cantrill</a> the degree<br/>of devotion should be obvious:</p><br/><i>"Have you tested your change in every way you know of ? If not, do not go any<br/>further with the integration unless you do so."</i><p>This implies that ordinary bug fix should have a unit test accompanying it.<br/>But, unit tests are cumbersome when performed by hand and do not mean much if they<br/>are not accumulated over time.</p><p>For integration of Netcat into OpenSolaris I have developed number of unit tests<br/>(basically at least one for each command line option) and couple more after spotting some bugs in nc(1).<br/>This means that nc(1) is ripe for having a test suite so the tests<br/>can be performed automatically. This is tracked by RFE 6646967. The test suite<br/>will live in <a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/test/ontest-stc2/">onnv-stc2</a> <br/>gate which is hosted and maintained by OpenSolaris<br/><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/testing/">Testing community</a>.</p><p>To create a test suite one can choose between two frameworks: STF and<br/><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/testing/testsuites/ctifortet/">CTI-TET</a>.<br/>I have chosen the latter because I wanted to try something new and also because<br/>CTI-TET seems to be the recommended framework these days.</p><p>The work on nc test suite has started during Christmas break 2007 and after <br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/entry/zfs_is_going_to_save">recovery from lost data</a><br/>it is now in pretty stable state and ready for code review.<br/>This is actually somewhat exciting because nc test suite is supposed to be the first OpenSolaris test <br/>suite <b>developed</b> in the open.</p><p>Fresh webrev is always stored on <a href="http://cr.opensolaris.org/">cr.opensolaris.org</a> in<br/><a href="http://cr.opensolaris.org/~vkotal/nc-tet.onnv-stc2/"><tt>nc-tet.onnv-stc2</tt></a> directory.<br/>Everybody is invited to participate in the code review.</p><p>Code review should be performed via <tt>testing-discuss at opensolaris.org</tt> mailing list (subscribe via <br/><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/testing/discussions/">Testing / Discussions</a>).<br/>It has web interface in the form of<br/><a href="http://opensolaris.org/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=22">testing-discuss forum</a>.</p><p>So, if you're familiar with <tt>ksh</tt> scripting or CTI-TET framework (both not necessary) <br/>you have unique chance to bash (not <tt>bash</tt>) my code ! Watch for official code review <br/>announcement on the mailing list in the next couple of days.</p><p>Lastly, another philosophical food for thought:<br/>Test suites are sets of programs and scripts which serve mainly one purpose - they should prevent bugs<br/>from happening in the software they test. But, test suites are software too. Presence of bugs in test suites<br/>is an annoying phenomenon. How to get rid of that one ?</p>
