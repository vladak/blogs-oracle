                                                                    <p>I have spent some time fixing bugs in KSSL (kernel SSL proxy) implementation in Solaris and got familar with it (and the KSSL development team) so with delight I can co-announce that the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kssl/">KSSL project</a> has been opened on <a href="http://opensolaris.org">opensolaris.org</a>.</p><p>To me, KSSL is one of the unique projects in the (Open)Solaris security land in a sense it is tightly integrated into the system and is a consumer of several major subsystems (networking, crypto framework) which makes it interesting for study and also for extending it in creative ways.</p><p>We will start adding more content to the pages, including design documentation and description of KSSL internals. Also, this marks major milestone in a way how KSSL team does its job. From now on all non-confidential discussions, reviews etc. will happen in the open. Feel free to join the project and participate if you're interested ! (become an <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kssl/observers/">observer</a> and join the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kssl/discussions/">mailing list</a>)</p>
