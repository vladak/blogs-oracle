                                                                    <p>When my friend from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Ast%C3%AD_nad_Labem"><br/>Usti nad Labem</a> (9th biggest city in Czech republic) asked me to present about <br/><a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a> at <a href="http://linux-meeting.enlogit.cz/program-2007">local Linux <br/>conference</a>, I got hooked. First, Usti is interesting<br/>city (the city is surrounded by beautiful countryside, yet has chemical plants in <br/>the vicinity of city center) and I haven't been there for <br/>a long time and second, having the opportunity to present about OpenSolaris technologies<br/>to Linux folks is unique.</p><p>When we (<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sashan/">Sasha</a> agreed to go present with me) <br/>arrived to Usti we were greeted by slightly apocalyptic weather (see pictures below).<br/>The environment where all the presentations took place compensated that, fortunately.</p><p>40 minutes to present about something which most people in the room are not very aware of<br/>is challenging. The fact that OpenSolaris is open source and it is a home for several<br/>disruptive technologies makes that both easier and harder. We have greatly leveraged <br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/">Bryan Cantrill</a>'s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8002801113289007228">Dtrace review video</a> taped at Google for doing second part of the presentation where we demo'ed <br/><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/">dtrace</a>. <br/>I have even borrowed some of<br/>his quotes. I am pretty sure he wouldn't object since his presentations were<br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tpenta/entry/reflections_on_linuxworld_sydney">perused in the past</a>. To make the list of attributions complete, we have substantial material<br/>in the first part from <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/lr/">Lukas</a>' past presentations about OpenSolaris project.</p><p>It's much better to demo the technology than just talk about how great it is<br/>(I remember a funny moment in Bryan's presentation where a dtrace probe didn't "want" to<br/>fire where Bryan jokingly said "bad demo!" to the screen. I nearly fell off of my chair <br/>at that moment.). "So, I have finally seen dtrace in action !" was one of the great things<br/>to hear after the presentation.</p><p>The "OpenSolaris technologies" presentation can be downloaded <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/resource/OpenSolaris_technologies.pdf">here</a>.</p><br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/resource/PICT0206.JPG"><img border="0" src="pict0206_small.JPG"><br/></a><br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/resource/PICT0212.JPG"><img border="0" src="pict0212_small.JPG"><br/></a><br/><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vlad/resource/PICT0213.JPG"><img border="0" src="pict0213_small.JPG"><br/></a>
