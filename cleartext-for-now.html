This means that my main job is to fix security bugs (both vulnerabilities and bugs in technologies) in <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>.</p><p>My fixes usually have to do something with following technologies/products: IPsec, SSH, OpenSSL and crypto. In this blog I will try to present not only security technologies but also <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>/<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a>-related stuff.</p>
